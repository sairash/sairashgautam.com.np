# Insearch of a new language

[<- Back to blogs](/blog)



I've been coding for a while now, mostly using the same mainstream languages that everyone else gravitates toward: `Go`, `Python`, `TypeScript`, `PHP`, `Lua`, and `C`. But I've realized I want to explore programming in a different way—not just sticking with these popular options. I’m not looking to learn a new language just for job prospects, either. Let's be honest—who knows how long we'll even have these jobs? (Yes, I’m looking at you, `Claude AI` 👀.)
<br/><br/>
I’m searching for an “escape language,” something I can use for personal side projects or maybe even my next `billion-dollar startup` (that probably won’t ever launch). It might take a while to find this perfect language, but I’m committed to the search. And I won’t stop until I find it.
