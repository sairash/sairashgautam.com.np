Hi there! I'm Sairash Sharma Gautam, a **"developer"** with a passion for creating and exploring the endless possibilities in tech. My coding journey began at age `13`, and it all started with a simple lesson on HTML in `Grade 5`. My computer teacher explained the difference between the **“head”** and **“body”** in a webpage, sparking an instant curiosity in me. That moment was the `seed` for a lifelong adventure into coding.

From the beginning, I've been driven by a desire to learn a little bit of everything. I firmly `believe` in the saying, “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” This mindset has shaped my journey, from experimenting with HTML to diving into C# to build games in Unity. My friends and I used to spend hours in our school’s computer lab, where I’d eagerly `showcase` my latest projects. Now, instead of games, I build and share web and mobile apps—some things never change!

Around five years ago, I took my first real steps into web development, `dreaming` to build my own social networking site. I knew only the basics of HTML and CSS at the time, and I stumbled more than once as I struggled with backend and frontend challenges. My first big project was an image-sharing site, an early “Instagram clone” where users could post images and browse others' with basic authentication. That project, built with PHP, HTML, and CSS, opened the door to a new world of web development.

Since then, I’ve explored a variety of languages and frameworks, `building everything` from a bus-booking app to an Airbnb clone. My tech toolkit grew to include Python for machine learning, Lua for writing lexers and parsers, Node.js for js backends , and frameworks like Laravel, Vue, and Svelte with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

My first job came in high school when I joined a team creating a web app that aimed to `connect gyms` across Nepal. It was a complex and challenging project, but it taught me a lot about real-world development. After a break to recharge and prepare for my SATs, I landed my `second job` as a full-stack developer, and I was thrilled to be doing what I love professionally.

Starting my journey early gave me a `unique` advantage and the `freedom` to experiment and learn. And I’m proud to say I finally achieved that original dream from years ago: creating my own social network, **“Dantyakatha.”** That’s my story, up to December 2021—just the `beginning`, really, of where I hope to go.
