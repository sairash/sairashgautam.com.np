# Hoisting in Danfe

[<- Back to blogs](/blog)

This is just a quick __update__, but an exciting one! I’ve successfully implemented `hoisting` in my own programming language, and it’s working beautifully. The process of solving a tricky scope issue turned out to be quite the adventure. I was chatting with someone when, mid-conversation, something clicked. It was like a spark went off in my head, and suddenly, I knew exactly how to tackle the problem. Funny enough, I even blurted it out to the person I was talking to—who, understandably, wasn’t thrilled that my brain had wandered elsewhere. But hey, inspiration strikes when it strikes, right?

That moment led me to finally crack the process for creating hoisting in _Danfe_, and I couldn’t be more thrilled. This language, which I’ve been building using Vlang, is shaping up better every day. For now, it’s a __"toy language"__ for experimenting and learning, but it’s paving the way for something much bigger: the `official` Danfe. This next version will be a fully compiled language with way more features, drawing from everything I’ve learned along the way. The journey has just begun, and I can’t wait to see where it goes!
