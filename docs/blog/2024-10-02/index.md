# Going To The Core

[<- Back to blogs](/blog)

For a very long time I have been intregued by how a bunch of transistors and capacitors could make such a complex machine that can power the `pinical` of creations. But I have never really gotten into learning about it. <br /> <br />
This week I will be going through everything including `gates` to find out how everything works. <br /> 

I will try to share what I learnt.
