# Exploring the Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda

[<- Back to blogs](/blog)

!["Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true‚Äù - Swami Vivekananda](https://akocdw82ai.ufs.sh/f/Jk6mQ2VBlE6tkyn18wsJtwzFSDqExs53HfM7VZuCG8KhWNOl)

I have followed Hindu traditions all my life without question. They told me God exists, so I simply accepted it. Traditions, rituals, and prayers were woven into daily life. But as I got older, I started to question things. *Why do we believe what we believe? How can so many religions claim to be exclusive* *truth?* This curiosity turned into a search for answers, leading me to debates, interfaith media, and finally, the inspiring words of Swami Vivekananda.

### The Crisis of Certainty

My journey mirrors a universal human struggle: reconciling faith with reason. I watched friends and strangers cling tightly to their religious beliefs, quickly dismissing others as "wrong" without hesitation. This rigidity baffled me. If billions find solace in different texts, how could any single path monopolize truth? One of my Hindu friend, devout and disciplined, urged me to dive into scripture. But I resisted. Reading ancient texts without context felt like navigating a labyrinth blindfolded. Worse, I feared losing myself in dogma, trading one set of unexamined beliefs for another.

### A Spark in Vivekananda‚Äôs Words

Then came Swami Vivekananda. His words struck me like lightning:

> It is good to love God for hope of reward in this or the next world, but it is better to love God for love's sake, and the prayer goes: "Lord, I do not want wealth, nor children, nor learning. If it be Thy will, I shall go from birth to birth, but grant me this, that I may love Thee without the hope of reward ‚Äî love unselfishly for love's sake."
> 
> Volume 1,¬†Addresses at The Parliament of Religions

Here was a voice that went beyond ritualistic contracts - a call to love the divine *selflessly*, not as a trade. For some reason I deeply resonated with it. Vivekananda didn't advocate blind following; he valued *experience* over strict beliefs. He criticized hollow religiosity, urging followers to seek truth through self-reflection and helping others. Suddenly, Hinduism wasn't just a list of rules but a philosophy of unity, where all paths eventually meet.

### The Reluctant Reader‚Äôs Revelation

Driven by curiosity, I started reading his *Complete Works*. His essays on religious tolerance, the universality of spiritual truths, and critiques of fanaticism seemed surprisingly modern. Vivekananda didn't reject other faiths; he viewed them as different sides of the same diamond. ‚ÄúWe believe not only in universal toleration,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúbut we accept all religions as true.‚Äù This wasn‚Äôt the Hinduism I was accustomed to - it was a call to rise above tribalism and embrace the divine in every soul.

### Where Am I Now?

Nine volumes in, I'm only on the second. My progress is slow but intentional. Vivekananda‚Äôs mix of logic and spirituality connects my doubts and desires. Next, I'll read the Bhagavad Gita. A text he respected as a guide to "spiritual manhood." I approach it not as a devotee but as a student, curious to see how its teachings align with Vivekananda‚Äôs idea of a religion that liberates rather than confines.

### Final Thoughts: Faith as a Journey, Not a Destination

Swami Vivekananda didn't give me answers; he gave me a mirror. His writings remind me that faith doesn't have to be fragile, it can handle questions and even grow stronger from them. For those struggling with doubt, I say this: It's okay to explore. It‚Äôs okay to demand more from your spirituality than inherited rituals. As Vivekananda taught, truth isn't a prize for the "right" religion; it‚Äôs the quiet flame that illuminates every sincere seeker‚Äôs path.

*Let the journey continue.* üî•

**P.S.** If you‚Äôve ever felt torn between faith and doubt, I‚Äôd love to hear your story. Sometimes, the most profound truths emerge not in certainty, but in the space between questions.
