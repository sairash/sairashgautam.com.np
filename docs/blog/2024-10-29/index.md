# Lexer -> Parser -> Evaluator

[<- Back to blogs](/blog)

I've been deep into developing a parser for the lexer I wrote in V, and it's been an incredible experience. Now, I’m slowly but surely converting the lexed data into parsed tokens with an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The Parser journy was fun and got to learn a lot of stuffs like, V doesn't have good tooling support especially the language server 👍.  But these challenges have just made it all the more engaging.

Now, I’m moving into the evaluation phase. This is where things really come to life, as I start to create my own evaluator and bring my programming language concept closer to reality. I’m excited to see how this evolves, and I’m hopeful I’ll have a working version within a month.
