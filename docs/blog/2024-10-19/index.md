# BRB. got dengue

[<- Back to blogs](/blog)

The dengue situation here in `Kathmandu` is spiraling out of control, with new cases rising every day. I had a **“fine until I wasn’t”** moment myself. I was perfectly okay in the morning—until a mosquito from who knows where got me. I didn’t even realize it at the time and have no idea when it happened. But by evening, my whole body started aching out of nowhere, and I couldn’t sleep at all. I was `freezing`, and the pain was `intense`.

Today, despite a `101°F fever`, I had to meet a client. Somehow, I made it through, got home, took some meds, and now here I am, writing this out. Fingers crossed that I recover soon and that it’s not as bad as everyone says.

P.S. I’m at `104°F` right now :wink:
