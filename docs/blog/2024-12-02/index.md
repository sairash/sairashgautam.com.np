# Advent Of Code 2024

[<- Back to blogs](/blog)

Have you ever heard of Advent of Code? It’s like an online [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar), but instead of chocolates, you get daily programming puzzles! These puzzles are designed for all skill levels and can be solved in any programming language you prefer. While many people use Advent of Code to learn new languages or prepare for coding competitions, I see it as a fun way to improve my programming skills and make my code faster and more efficient.

I’ve always wanted to participate, but life got in the way. This year, though, I’ve decided to make time and dive in! It’s only Day 2, and I’ve heard that most people typically solve puzzles up to Day 6 or Day 10. I’m curious to see how far I can go - can I beat that? The excitement is real, and I can’t wait to tackle more puzzles!
