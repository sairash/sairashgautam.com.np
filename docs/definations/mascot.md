I created this character back in `2020` on `Snapchat`, and it has remained the same since then. My website is very `minimal`; some people might even call it `bland`. So, these `images` will be added in various places to help build some `personality` and `uniqueness`.

For anyone `wondering` how I get these images, let me tell you it's very `simple`. Just go to [**Bitmoji**](https://bitmoji.com/), create your avatar, and you can get `hundreds` of images like these.
