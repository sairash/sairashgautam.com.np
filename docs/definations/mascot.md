# Mascot
This character was made by me back in `2020` in `snapchat` and it has stayed the same since. My website is very `minimal`, some people might even say it's `bland`. So, these `images` will be intregrated at different places to help build some `personality` and `uniquness`. <br> <br>

For anyone `wondering`, How am I even able to get these images. Let me tell you it's very `simple`. Just go to [Bitmoji](https://bitmoji.com), create your avatar and you can get `hundreds` of images like these.
