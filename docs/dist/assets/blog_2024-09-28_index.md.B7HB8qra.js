I&#39;m Sairash Sharma Gautam, a <strong>&quot;developer&quot;</strong> with a passion for creating and exploring the endless possibilities in tech. My coding journey began at age <code>13</code>, and it all started with a simple lesson on HTML in <code>Grade 5</code>. My computer teacher explained the difference between the <strong>“head”</strong> and <strong>“body”</strong> in a webpage, sparking an instant curiosity in me. That moment was the <code>seed</code> for a lifelong adventure into coding.</p><p>From the beginning, I&#39;ve been driven by a desire to learn a little bit of everything. I firmly <code>believe</code> in the saying, “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” This mindset has shaped my journey, from experimenting with HTML to diving into C# to build games in Unity. My friends and I used to spend hours in our school’s computer lab, where I’d eagerly <code>showcase</code> my latest projects. Now, instead of games, I build and share web and mobile apps—some things never change!</p><p>Around five years ago, I took my first real steps into web development, <code>dreaming</code> to build my own social networking site. I knew only the basics of HTML and CSS at the time, and I stumbled more than once as I struggled with backend and frontend challenges. My first big project was an image-sharing site, an early “Instagram clone” where users could post images and browse others&#39; with basic authentication. That project, built with PHP, HTML, and CSS, opened the door to a new world of web development.</p><p>Since then, I’ve explored a variety of languages and frameworks, <code>building everything</code> from a bus-booking app to an Airbnb clone. My tech toolkit grew to include Python for machine learning, Lua for writing lexers and parsers, Node.js for js backends , and frameworks like Laravel, Vue, and Svelte with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.</p><p>My first job came in high school when I joined a team creating a web app that aimed to <code>connect gyms</code> across Nepal. It was a complex and challenging project, but it taught me a lot about real-world development. After a break to recharge and prepare for my SATs, I landed my <code>second job</code> as a full-stack developer, and I was thrilled to be doing what I love professionally.</p><p>Starting my journey early gave me a <code>unique</code> advantage and the <code>freedom</code> to experiment and learn. And I’m proud to say I finally achieved that original dream from years ago: creating my own social network, <strong>“Dantyakatha.”</strong> That’s my story, up to December 2021—just the <code>beginning</code>, really, of where I hope to go.</p><p><a href="https://letterbird.co/sai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reply via Email</a></p><p><img style="max-height:170px;position:absolute;right:0;margin-top:-60px;" src="'+r+'"></p><p><span style="color:gray;font-size:14px;">Date: 2024-09-28</span></p>',12)]))}const b=a(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,b as default};
