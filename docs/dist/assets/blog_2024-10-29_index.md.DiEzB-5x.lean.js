Now, I‚Äôm slowly but surely converting the lexed data into parsed tokens with an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The Parser journy was fun and got to learn a lot of stuffs like, V doesn&#39;t have good tooling support especially the language server üëç. But these challenges have just made it all the more engaging.</p><p>Now, I‚Äôm moving into the evaluation phase.
