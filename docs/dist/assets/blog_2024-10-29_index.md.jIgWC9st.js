Now, I‚Äôm slowly but surely converting the lexed data into parsed tokens with an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The Parser journy was fun and got to learn a lot of stuffs like, V doesn&#39;t have good tooling support especially the language server üëç. But these challenges have just made it all the more engaging.</p><p>Now, I‚Äôm moving into the evaluation phase. This is where things really come to life, as I start to create my own evaluator and bring my programming language concept closer to reality. I‚Äôm excited to see how this evolves, and I‚Äôm hopeful I‚Äôll have a working version within a month.</p><p><a href="https://letterbird.co/sai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reply via Email</a></p><img src="'+n+'" style="height:170px;position:absolute;right:0;"><p><span style="color:gray;font-size:14px;">Date: 2024-10-29</span></p>',7)]))}const u=a(s,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
