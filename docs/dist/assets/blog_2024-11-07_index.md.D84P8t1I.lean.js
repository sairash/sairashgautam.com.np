If I could go back and tell my younger self that I’d someday create a language, I probably wouldn’t believe it at first. But then, I know I would be so proud of me.</p><p>The language, <a href="https://danfe.sairashgautam.com.np" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Danfe</a>, is similar to <a href="https://lua.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lua</a>, with some inspiration from <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Python</a> as well. It’s built in <a href="https://vlang.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">V</a> and is interpreted—though a compiled version would sound pretty impressive, wouldn’t it? Who knows, maybe a <code>C</code> compiler written in Danfe isn’t that far-fetched! 😉 Danfe is Turing complete, and it can even leverage V code directly, so there’s a lot of potential.</p><p>This blog post marks the official release of Danfe, though right now, me and some of my friends are the only users. I’ll be iterating rapidly, updating the code and adjusting the release binaries directly. There’s a lot I’d like to improve in Danfe, and part of me wonders if I should continue in V or keep <a href="./../2024-10-11/">searching for that one language</a> I originally set out to find. My long-term vision is to make Danfe both interpreted and compiled, with a multi-backend compiler that can output to <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>Go</code>, <code>ASM</code>, and more.</p><p>There’s still plenty of development ahead, and my <code>goal</code> isn’t to “finish” the project so much as to build something versatile and capable of compiling to various languages.</p><p>You might notice I haven’t mentioned any setbacks during development, and honestly, I don’t really think there were any set back other than life comming in between me and this project. I encourage eveyone to <code>give it a try</code>! There is never a world where having too much programming languages is an issue.</p><br><p><strong>Previos Related Blogs:</strong></p><p><a href="./../2024-10-29/">Lexer -&gt; Parser -&gt; Evaluation</a></p><p><a href="./../2024-10-14/">Wrote a lexer in VLANG</a></p><p><a href="./../2024-10-11/">Insearch of a new language</a></p><p><span style="color:gray;font-size:14px;">Date: 2024-11-07</span></p><br><div style="margin-top:-250px;"><img src="https://utfs.io/f/Jk6mQ2VBlE6tJvy6SfVBlE6tumDzfiKX2RrbsTLOPYUd4IV8" style="height:150px;position:absolute;right:0;"><img src="'+r+'" style="height:170px;position:absolute;right:30px;margin-top:-20px;"></div>',16)]))}const c=a(i,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,c as default};
